 Let's write a Python function to solve the puzzle.

def count_houses_with_presents(directions):
    # This will hold the coordinates of the houses as tuples.
    visited_houses = set()
    # Start at position (0, 0).
    x, y = 0, 0
    # Add the starting house to the set of visited houses.
    visited_houses.add((x, y))

    # Iterate over each direction in the string.
    for move in directions:
        # Move to the next house according to the direction.
        if move == '^':  # North
            y += 1
        elif move == 'v':  # South
            y -= 1
        elif move == '>':  # East
            x += 1
        elif move == '<':  # West
            x -= 1
        # Add the new house position to the set.
        visited_houses.add((x, y))

    # The number of houses with at least one present is the size of the set.
    return len(visited_houses)

# Example usage:
# Assuming you have the directions string, it can be called like this:
# directions = "^^v^>>v<<v^^>>vv<<"
# print(count_houses_with_presents(directions))

# Since we don't have the actual input, I'll write the code in a way that you can
# later use it by passing the directions string you retrieve from your file.

# For now, let's test it with the examples given in the image.
test_directions_1 = '>'
test_directions_2 = '^>v<'
test_directions_3 = '^v^v^v^v^v'

# Test the function with the provided examples
example_1_houses = count_houses_with_presents(test_directions_1)
example_2_houses = count_houses_with_presents(test_directions_2)
example_3_houses = count_houses_with_presents(test_directions_3)

(example_1_houses, example_2_houses, example_3_houses)

with open('directions.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the contents of the file.
    directions = file.read()x
